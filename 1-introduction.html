# Introduction to tidymodels

# Our goals for this workshop

* Introduce tidymodels and its general philosophy on modeling. 

* Help you become proficient with the core packages for modeling. 

* Point you to places to learn more and get help. 

---
# Why tidymodels?

There are several other modeling frameworks in R that try to:

 * create a uniform, cohesive, and unsurprising set of modeling APIs
 
Examples are &lt;span class="pkg"&gt;caret&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="pkg"&gt;mlr3&lt;/span&gt;, and others. 

* &lt;span class="pkg"&gt;caret&lt;/span&gt; is more favorable for people who prefer base R/traditional interfaces.

* tidymodels would probably be preferable to those who place importance on a tidy _R_ interface, a large number of features, and the idea that the interfaces should enable the "pit of success". 

* &lt;span class="pkg"&gt;mlr3&lt;/span&gt; is more pythonic and also has many features.

# The tidymodels design goals




---
# The tidymodels package

There are a lot of tidymodels packages but about 90% of the work is done by 5 packages. 

The best way to get started with tidymodels is to use the &lt;span class="pkg"&gt;tidymodels&lt;/span&gt; meta-package. It loads the core packages plus some tidyverse packages.

Some helpful links:

 * List of [all tidymodels functions](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/#search-all-of-tidymodels)
 * List of [all parsnip models](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/parsnip/)
 * List of [all recipe steps](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/recipes/)

# Example data set


These data are used in our [Feature Engineering and Selection](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/chicago-intro.html) book. 

Several years worth of pre-pandemic data were assembled to try to predict the daily number of people entering the Clark and Lake elevated ("L") train station in Chicago. 

For predictors, 

* the 14-day lagged ridership at this and other stations (units: thousands of rides/day)
* weather data
* home/away game schedules for Chicago teams
* the date

The data are in `modeldata`. See `?Chicago`.
